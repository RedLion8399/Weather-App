# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built with [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) as an exercise in computer science class at [Europag-Gymnasium Warstein](https://gymnasium-warstein.de/).
As it is meant for educational purposes, it will not be either on an industry level nor be hosted on the web.

Further documentation might be available in the future in this document or maybe it won't ...
